This app is demonstrates the UberColorPickerDialog class I created, 
derived from the ColorPickerDialog example in the API Demos. 
Any developers who would like to use or modify this class for their own
applications can obtain it at http://keithwiley.com/Downloads/AndroidUberColorPickerDemo.zip.\n\n

Thank you.\n\n
